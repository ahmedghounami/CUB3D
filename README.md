CUB3D is an exciting project that allows you to explore the principles of ray-casting by creating a dynamic 3D view inside a maze. Inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D game, this project provides a hands-on experience with fundamental concepts in graphics and game development.

### Key Features

- **Ray-Casting Engine**: Implement a basic 3D engine to render a maze-like environment.
- **MiniMap System**: Includes a minimap to give players a broader view of the maze.
- **Dynamic Textures**: Apply different wall textures based on orientation.
- **Realistic Controls**: Navigate the maze using WASD for movement and arrow keys for rotation.
- **Mouse Look**: Advanced bonus feature allowing you to control the view with the mouse.
- **Animated Sprites**: Implement animated sprites for added visual effects.
